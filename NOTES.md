# MillenAI — developer notes

A local-only LLM desktop app for macOS. Everything runs on the user's machine:
models, transcription, speech, memory. Nothing is sent anywhere except
optional DuckDuckGo lookups and the GitHub update check.

Current: **1.0** (build 14) · repo `bigmillz/MillenAI`

## Layout

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `millenai.py` | The whole app — HTTP backend, model routing, and the UI as one embedded HTML string (~3,400 lines) |
| `build_macos_app.sh` | Wraps `millenai.py` into `MillenAI.app` |
| `build_dmg.sh` | Builds the app, then a styled DMG with custom artwork and Finder layout |
| `release.sh` | Bumps version → builds → commits → pushes → publishes a GitHub Release |
| `MillenAI.icns` | App/volume icon |

Not in git (see `.gitignore`): built `.app`, `.dmg`, `__pycache__`, and
`v23-*.sh` — those are unrelated VPN scripts and one contains a private
server address.

## Running it

```bash
python3 millenai.py          # serves on 127.0.0.1:8889, opens a pywebview window
```

Everything user-generated lives outside the bundle, so updates never
clobber it:

- `~/Library/Application Support/MillenAI/venv` — private Python env
- `~/Library/Application Support/MillenAI/memory.json` — long-term memory
- `~/Library/Logs/MillenAI/` — engine + bootstrap logs
- Chat history — WebKit localStorage, keyed to the bundle id

## Releasing

```bash
./release.sh 15 "1.1"
```

Bumps `APP_BUILD`/`APP_VERSION`, rebuilds, pushes, and creates Release `v15`
with the DMG attached. Installed copies compare against it daily and offer
the update in-place.

**`APP_VERSION` and `APP_BUILD` in `millenai.py` are the single source of
truth.** Both build scripts read them at build time — the Info.plist, DMG
volume name, filename, and artwork all derive from them. This exists because
earlier releases shipped with mismatched versions in three different places.

Needs `gh` authenticated (`brew install gh && gh auth login`). Tokens stay in
the Keychain; nothing is stored in the repo.

## How it works

### Model catalog
One `CATALOG` list defines all 17 models: label, icon, MLX repo, Ollama tag,
port, RAM need, download size. Everything else derives from it —
`MODEL_ROUTES`, `MLX_REPOS`, `MODEL_MEM_BYTES`, `SUPPORTED`, the sidebar rows.
Adding a model is one line.

Apple silicon prefers MLX (fast Metal); Intel falls back to Ollama for the
same models. A model with no Ollama tag is greyed out as "Apple silicon only".

### Tiers
`Fast` (1 model) → `Thinking` (3, plus a "reason step by step" hint) →
`Pro` (5) → `Power` (everything that fits, under *All models*). Each resolves
at request time against what is actually downloaded *and* fits in current free
RAM, then tops up with any other installed model, strongest first.

Blending is sequential — **only one MLX engine can be resident at a time**,
since each pins its full weights in RAM. Parallel calls thrash.

Excluded from auto-blending: vision models (`LLaVA`) and anything under
2.4 GB (1B-class models produce degenerate output).

### The merger
Gemma 2 9B IT writes the final blended answer. This was measured, not
assumed — same three drafts containing nine distinct facts, merged by each
candidate:

| merger | time | words | facts kept | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Gemma 2 9B IT** | 11.9s | 121 | **9/9** | concise, clean |
| Mistral Nemo 12B | 13.8s | 207 | 9/9 | injects markdown headers |
| Llama 3.1 8B | 11.3s | 260 | 9/9 | verbose |
| DeepSeek R1 | 18.3s | 183 | 8/9 | slow, **invented a fact** |

Drafts are capped at the 5 strongest and truncated to ~1,500 chars each —
an unbounded merge prompt overflows small models and triggers repetition
loops.

### Memory
Facts about the user are extracted in the background after each message by
whichever model just answered, stored in `memory.json`, and folded into the
system prompt. Best-effort: failures never break a chat. Clear it from the
About panel.

### Voice
STT is Whisper large-v3-turbo via MLX (Apple silicon only, ~1.6 GB, fetched
on first mic tap). TTS is the macOS `say` binary — free, no download, works
on Intel. Voice chat mode auto-sends after transcription and reads replies
aloud; a new message or mic tap barges in.

### Updates
Polls GitHub Releases once a day. A release counts as newer if its
`published_at` is after this build's timestamp, or its tag carries a higher
build number. Downloading hands off to a helper script that waits for the app
to quit, swaps the bundle, strips quarantine, and relaunches.

## Gotchas

Things that cost real debugging time. Most are non-obvious and will bite
again if forgotten.

**Gemma rejects the `system` role.** Its chat template errors outright. The
app detects this and retries with the system prompt folded into the first
user turn.

**`duckduckgo_search` is dead.** Renamed to `ddgs`; the old package still
imports fine but returns **zero results silently**. Web search was quietly
broken until this was caught. Use `ddgs`.

**Hugging Face's Xet backend hides progress.** Files only materialise at the
end, so progress bars sit at 0% then jump. `HF_HUB_DISABLE_XET=1` is set at
import to force the classic CDN path (also dodges harsher anonymous rate
limits).

**`config.json` is not a completeness signal.** It lands early in a download.
Completeness requires the safetensors, every shard named in the index, and
zero `*.incomplete` blobs — otherwise models report "ready" at 1% downloaded.

**`atexit` does not run on SIGTERM.** Force-quitting orphaned multi-GB model
servers every time. Signal handlers are installed for TERM/INT/HUP.

**Ollama tag matching must be exact.** Having `llama3.2:latest` does not mean
`llama3.2:3b` will resolve — Ollama 404s. Loose matching made models look
ready when chat would fail.

**GitHub timestamps are UTC.** `time.mktime` reads them as local, making every
release look hours newer than it is — so every install would nag about an
update to the version it is already running. Use `calendar.timegm`.

**launchd `KeepAlive` agents are a trap.** The old autostart agents fought the
Ollama menubar app for port 11434 and respawned instantly when OOM-killed,
producing two permanent crash loops and ~14 GB of pinned RAM that survived
quitting the app. The app manages its own engines now; those agents are
removed.

**1B models write garbage titles.** Observed looping "address address
address…" for 16k characters. Title generation requires a ≥2.4 GB model.

**Few-shot prompts confuse small chat models.** Given completion-style
examples, they echo the examples instead of reading the actual message.
Direct instructions work; few-shot does not.

**Temporal dead zone kills the whole script silently.** A `let` referenced
during boot before its declaration throws, aborting everything after it —
with no console error if the tab attached late. Declare shared state at the
top. Syntax-check the served page (`node --check`) as part of verification.

### macOS packaging

**Finder only persists a DMG window size if it sees the bounds *change*
while frontmost.** Set them twice with a one-pixel nudge.

**Apply the volume icon *after* the Finder styling pass** — that pass deletes
`.VolumeIcon.icns` and clears the custom-icon flag.

**Stale mounts break builds.** A leftover `/Volumes/MillenAI …` makes the
styling step fail with "Can't get disk". The script now detaches first and
waits for the volume to appear.

**macOS 15+ removed right-click → Open.** Unnotarized apps must be allowed
via System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Open Anyway. The DMG artwork
explains this in three numbered steps. Ad-hoc signing (free) does *not*
satisfy Gatekeeper — only paid notarization does. AirDrop sets no quarantine
flag at all and sidesteps the whole thing.

## Porting to Windows

**46 of 3,394 lines touch macOS specifics — about 1.4%.** The UI, tiers,
blending, memory, chat history, search and updater are all portable.

What must be replaced: MLX → Ollama (CUDA is genuinely faster than Apple
silicon here), `mlx-whisper` → `faster-whisper`, `say` → SAPI, `ioreg` → 
`nvidia-smi`/WMI, and DMG/codesign → an Inno Setup installer with an `.exe`
swap in the updater. Roughly two to three days, mostly testing.

The right shape is one `platform.py` answering four questions — run a model,
transcribe, speak, read the GPU — not a fork. `MODEL_ROUTES` and the tier
resolver already separate "which engine" from "what the app does".
